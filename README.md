## vue-cli 3 is used for the project
## Sample form validation using vee-validate 2.2.10 and warning on the same field
## It validates age of a person. Age is a required field and it needs to be a non-negative number, otherwise validation fails and shows an error. It also shows an warning if the age is not 36.
## The important point is if validation fails then it shows error message, no warning is shown. Warning is shown only when validation passes.
